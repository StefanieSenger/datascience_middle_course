# My Solutions for Data Science Course

These are my solutions for the Data Science Middle Course / Traces Course by Guillaume Lemaitre.

The actual solutions can be found along with the notebooks [on the course repo](https://github.com/glemaitre/datascience_middle_course).

A newer and a bit different version of this course from 2024 can be found [here](https://glemaitre.github.io/traces-sklearn/intro.html).

This repo contains a mixture of both course versions with my own notes, questions, experiments and solutions sprinkled in. It is far from tidy, but very useful for myself.
