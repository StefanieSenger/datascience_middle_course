Then an estimator was trained on each of these different datasets and the different results were aggregated. In boosting, the paradigm is different: the estimators will be trained on the same dataset. Thus, to combine them, we will train an estimator to correct the error of all previous estimators.

    "For gradient-boosting, parameters are coupled, so we cannot set the parameters one after the other anymore. The important parameters are `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `learning_rate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s first discuss the `max_depth` parameter. We saw in the section on gradient-boosting that the algorithm fits the error of the previous tree in the ensemble. Thus, fitting fully grown trees will be detrimental. Indeed, the first tree of the ensemble would perfectly fit (overfit) the data and thus no subsequent tree would be required, since there would be no residuals. Therefore, the tree used in gradient-boosting should have a low depth, typically between 3 to 8 levels. Having very weak learners at each step will help reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this consideration in mind, the deeper the trees, the faster the residuals will be corrected and less learners are required. Therefore, `n_estimators` should be increased if `max_depth` is lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have overlooked the impact of the `learning_rate` parameter until now. When fitting the residuals, we would like the tree to try to correct all possible errors or only a fraction of them. The learning-rate allows you to control this behaviour. A small learning-rate value would only correct the residuals of very few samples. If a large learning-rate is set (e.g., 1), we would fit the residuals of all samples. So, with a very low learning-rate, we will need more estimators to correct the overall error. However, a too large learning-rate tends to obtain an overfitted ensemble, similar to having a too large tree depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will come back in the next chapter how to find the best set of hyperparameters in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "An option that is useful in histogram gradient boosting is the `early_stopping` parameter. This will split the data internally during `fit` and use a validation set to assess the improvement of adding a new decision tree regressor. If the model detect that adding new estimators will not improve the statistical performance of the model, it will stop the `fit` process. Let's check in practice how it works:"
